Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Steve. I live in England, run UI development at [Maersk](https://www.maersk.com) and help to organise [Berkshire JS](https://berkshirejs.com/). Over the years I have run web engineering for [yell.com](https://www.yell.com), and been a Management Consultant at [PA](https://www.paconsulting.com/) in London. I design and create applications and web sites using the latest standards-compliant and accessible technology. Simply put, I try to make the web a better place for everyone.


From 2008 to 2013 I was an organiser for [London Web Standards](https://www.londonwebstandards.org/), a meet-up group who advise and evangelise web standards. In 2012 I started giving talks at technical conferences around the country, which can all be seen on my [speaking page over on my blog](https://www.steveworkman.com/speaking/).


I'm originally from the North-West of England, and I graduated from the University of Sheffield in 2007 with a masters in Computer Science. I play hockey for [Sonning Hockey Club](https://www.sonninghockeyclub.co.uk/) in Reading
