Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Steve. I live in the UK and run Front-end engineering for [Maersk](https://www.maersk.com). In the past I've run web engineering for [yell.com](https://www.yell.com), and been a Management Consultant at [PA](https://www.paconsulting.com/) in London. I design and create web apps and sites using the latest standards-compliant and accessible technology. Simply put, I try to make the web a better place for everyone.


From 2008 to 2013 I was an organiser for [London Web Standards](https://www.londonwebstandards.org/), a meet-up group who advise and evangelise web standards. In 2012 I started giving talks at technical conferences around the country, which can all be seen on my [speaking page over on my blog](https://www.steveworkman.com/speaking/). I briefly ran another meetup group in 2019-2020 called [Berkshire JS](https://berkshirejs.com/)


I'm originally from the North-West of England, and I graduated from the University of Sheffield with a masters in Computer Science. I play hockey for [Sonning Hockey Club](https://www.sonninghockeyclub.co.uk/) whenever my rapidly aging body allows me.
